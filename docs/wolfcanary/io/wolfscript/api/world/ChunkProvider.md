### Interface Overview

Chunk Provider interface. This has two purposes.<br> One is to wrap the ChunkProviderServer in the NMS implementation. <br> The other, much more interesting purpose is to be implemented by Plugins, then mapped to dimension types - in order to provide custom world generation.<br> <h4>Custom World Generation</h4> This is the interface everything related to world generation boils down to. A world will use this to create its terrain and call the provideChunk methid.
