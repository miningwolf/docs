## HelpTopic __class__

>io.wolfscript.help.HelpTopic

### Class Overview

HelpTopic implementations are displayed to the user when the user uses the /help command. <p> Custom implementations of this class can work at two levels. A simple implementation only needs to set the value of `name`, `shortText`, and `fullText` in the constructor. This base class will take care of the rest. <p> Complex implementations can be created by overriding the behavior of all the methods in this class.
