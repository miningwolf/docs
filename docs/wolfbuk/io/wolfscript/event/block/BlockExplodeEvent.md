### Public Methods for [`Event`](..\Event.md)

##### <a id='isasynchronous'></a>public final function __isAsynchronous__()

_The default constructor is defined for cleaner code. This constructor assumes the event is synchronous. /
    public Event() {
        this(false);
    }

    /** This constructor is used to explicitly declare an event as synchronous or asynchronous._

Returns | Description
--- | --- 
`boolean` | name of this event /
    public String getEventName() {
        if (name == null) {
            name = getClass().getSimpleName();
        }
        return name;
    }

    public abstract HandlerList getHandlers();

    /** Any custom event that should not by synchronized with other events must use the specific constructor. These are the caveats of using an asynchronous event: <ul> <li>The event is never fired from inside code triggered by a synchronous event. Attempting to do so results in an `IllegalStateException`. <li>However, asynchronous event handlers may fire synchronous or asynchronous events <li>The event may be fired multiple times simultaneously and in any order. <li>Any newly registered or unregistered handler is ignored after an event starts execution. <li>The handlers for this event may block for any length of time. <li>Some implementations may selectively declare a specific event use as asynchronous. This behavior should be clearly defined. <li>Asynchronous calls are not calculated in the plugin timing system. </ul>
