### Public Methods for [`PortalCreateEvent`](PortalCreateEvent.md)

##### <a id='iscancelled'></a>public  function __isCancelled__()

_isCancelled method_

Returns | 
--- | 
`boolean` |


---
### Public Constructors for [`WorldEvent`](WorldEvent.md)

##### <a id='worldevent'></a>new __WorldEvent__(World) 

_WorldEvent constructor_

Argument | Type | Description  
--- | --- | --- 
World | `final` | World argument

---

### Public Properties for [`WorldEvent`](WorldEvent.md)

##### <a id='world'></a>public  readonly property __World__

_Get: Gets the world primarily involved with this event_

Get | Description
--- | --- 
`World` | World which caused this event



---
### Public Constructors for [`Event`](../Event.md)

##### <a id='event'></a>new __Event__() 

_The default constructor is defined for cleaner code. This constructor assumes the event is synchronous._


##### <a id='event'></a>new __Event__(isAsync) 

_This constructor is used to explicitly declare an event as synchronous or asynchronous._

Argument | Type | Description  
--- | --- | --- 
isAsync | `boolean` | true indicates the event will fire asynchronously, false by default from default constructor

---

### Public Properties for [`Event`](../Event.md)

##### <a id='eventname'></a>public  readonly property __EventName__

_Get: Convenience method for providing a user-friendly identifier. By default, it is the event's class's {@linkplain Class#getSimpleName() simple name}._

Get | Description
--- | --- 
`String` | name of this event



##### <a id='handlers'></a>public abstract readonly property __Handlers__

_Handlers property_

Get | 
--- | 
[`HandlerList`](../HandlerList.md) |



---

### Public Methods for [`Event`](../Event.md)

##### <a id='isasynchronous'></a>public final function __isAsynchronous__()

_Any custom event that should not by synchronized with other events must use the specific constructor. These are the caveats of using an asynchronous event: <ul> <li>The event is never fired from inside code triggered by a synchronous event. Attempting to do so results in an `IllegalStateException`. <li>However, asynchronous event handlers may fire synchronous or asynchronous events <li>The event may be fired multiple times simultaneously and in any order. <li>Any newly registered or unregistered handler is ignored after an event starts execution. <li>The handlers for this event may block for any length of time. <li>Some implementations may selectively declare a specific event use as asynchronous. This behavior should be clearly defined. <li>Asynchronous calls are not calculated in the plugin timing system. </ul>_

Returns | Description
--- | --- 
`boolean` | false by default, true if the event fires asynchronously
